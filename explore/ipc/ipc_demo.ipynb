    "# Symbiote's IPC Server\n",
    "\n",
    "One of my contributions to the Symbiote project is what we call the IPC server. Normally, symbiote system users might think that any application entering a risky “elevated” state is unsafe and concerning. The solution to this is our IPC server: a single centralized approved application that runs in a proven-to-be-safe elevated state. <br>\n",
    "It has two main purposes: security and optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Security\n",
    " \n",
    "This model allows a whitelisted admin-approved symbiote application running in an elevated supervisor mode transparently improve performance and efficiency of other applications. This allows user applications to not worry about crashing the entire system or messing something up as the ipc server handles incorrect input and safely performs the necessary privileged operations.<br>\n",
    "Additionally, for security-intensive systems, it might be unwanted to let normal users run privileged code, so the solution to that is running a single whitelisted symbiote daemon that handles shortcutting requests accordingly. It would also allow the community to test it along with other symbiote tools and help improve its security features.<br>\n",
    "The admin can also enable or disable the ipc server like a module, modify it's configured behavior, and/or change number of threads dedicated to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever a user application would like to perform a shortcutted system call, our ipc interposer library transparently intercepts a normal system call and sends a request through shared memory to the ipc server. The server, in turn, performs the shortcutted version of the system call and returns the result back to the user application. This allows applications to gain essentially free speedups in performance-critical paths, since a shortcutted server might yield better performance and cacheing, and knows how to execute privileged supervisor instructions safely without crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note\n",
    "This approach is also ABI compatible, meaning no code modifications are required for original binaries of user applications!"
